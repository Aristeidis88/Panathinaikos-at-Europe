Amongst their major titles <br> are 20 Greek Championships, 18 Greek Cups, achieving eight times the Double, and 3 Greek Super CupsThey <br> are also one of the two clubs that won a championship undefeated, going without a loss in a top-flight <br> campaign in the 1963–64 season. <br><br>

It is also the only Greek team that <br> has played for the Intercontinental Cup (1971). Furthermore, they have reached the quarter-finals of the Champions <br> League on another two occasions (in 1992 and 2002), as well as the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup twice <br> (1988 and 2003). They have also won the Balkans Cup in 1997. Panathinaikos is a member of the European Club Association. <br><br>
    
    Since the 1950s, the club maintains some of the oldest and most successful academies in Greece, producing talent for <br> the first team and feeding the Greek national football team. They have played their home games in the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium, <br> considered their traditional home ground, and the Athens Olympic Stadium. <br><br>
